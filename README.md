# Deep Driving

Autonomous driving using direct perception in TORCS using Caffe for deep learning.

This code is a modified version Princeton's Deep Driving http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/, which was published to back the results claimed in http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/paper.pdf.

The project report for the code in this repo can be found in report.pdf.

Results for the original implementation:
