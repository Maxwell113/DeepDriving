# Deep Driving

Autonomous driving using deep learning (Caffe) in TORCS-- open source car racing game.

This code is a modified version Princeton's Deep Driving http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/, which was published to back the results claimed in http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/paper.pdf.

The project report for the code in this repo can be found in saiprabhakar.github.io/projects.html.
